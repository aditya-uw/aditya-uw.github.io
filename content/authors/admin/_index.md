## About Me

I am a student at the University of Washington majoring in Electrical Engineering and pursuing Digital Signal Processing and Neural Engineering concentrations. I am expected to graduate the Spring of 2024 and am interested in pursuing graduate research after my bachelor's degree.

My core competency is in programming, with an expertise in Python and Java. I am currently applying signal processing techniques in passive acoustic monitoring of bats with a goal toward ecological conservation.

Feel free to ask me any questions at my email on pursuing research as an undergraduate!
